# AOYTK
All Our Yesterdays Toolkit

## Purpose

This utility is used for getting derivatives of WARC files into a structured Colab environment for analysis and further export. 


## Preparation

Create a _dervivative_ of a `WARC` file using the Archives Unleashed Toolkit using this [notebook](). All you need is a URL to a WARC. If you already have a _derivative_ upload it to a folder in your Google Drive.

## Analysis

Premade Notebooks to analyze different derivative types are outlined in the following chart. These types are based on the output of [ARCH](https://support.archive-it.org/hc/en-us/articles/360061122492-Introduction-to-the-Archive-It-Research-Services-Cloud). General categories are in **figure 1**.
