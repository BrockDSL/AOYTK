# All Our Yesterdays
A toolkit to explore Web Archives

## Purpose

This utility is used for getting derivatives of WARC files into a structured Colab environment for analysis and further export. 


## Preparation

Two options are available to get your data ready

- Create your own derivative directly in the [ARCH interface](https://webdata.archive-it.org/ait/login) and save it to a folder in **Google Drive**
- Create a _dervivative_ of any `WARC` file you have using the AOY Derivative Creation Notebook, which will save it to **Google Drive** for use by the **Analysis** Notebooks.

## Analysis

Premade Notebooks to analyze different derivative types are outlined in the following chart. These types are based on the output of [ARCH](https://support.archive-it.org/hc/en-us/articles/360061122492-Introduction-to-the-Archive-It-Research-Services-Cloud). General categories are in **figure 1**.
