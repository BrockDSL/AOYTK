Our thanks and compliments go to your predecessor, Mr. Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, for his outstanding leadership of the forty-first session. The international community is aware of the recent political and constitutional developments which have led to the change of Government in Fiji. The situation is an Internal matter which the people of Fiji must be allowed to resolve in their own way. Interference of any kind from outside will not help in resolving our domestic difficulties, and we urge all Member States to show understanding of our situation. Looking back at the international scene over this past year, my Governmen...   \n",
